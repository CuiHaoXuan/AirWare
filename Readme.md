We introduce AirWare, an in-air hand-gesture recognition system that uses the already embedded speaker and microphone in most
electronic devices, together with low-cost infrared proximity sensors. Gestures identified by AirWare are performed in the air above a
touchscreen or a mobile phone. AirWare utilizes deep neural networks to identify complex hand gestures using multi-modal audio
Doppler signatures and infrared (IR) sensor information. This work is an improvement on present-day systems which use high
frequency Doppler radars or depth cameras to uniquely identify in-air gestures.
